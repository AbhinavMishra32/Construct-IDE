# Construct Implementation Ledger

This file tracks the implementation phases, current status, shipped scope, and verification state for Construct.

## Baseline

- Repository initialized from a single README-only commit.
- Product name locked to `Construct`.
- Workspace/tooling direction: `pnpm` + `Turborepo`.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Repo & boilerplate | Implemented | Monorepo scaffold, Electron desktop shell, runner service, root scripts, and workspace configs are in place. |
| 1 | Shared schemas & canonical sample project | Implemented | Shared schemas, blueprint validation script, real workflow runtime sample project, and Jest tests are in place. |
| 2 | File manager & snapshotting | Implemented | Workspace-scoped file IO and a separate internal git snapshot store now exist in the runner, with restore coverage for edits, creations, and deletions. |
| 3 | Test runner & adapters | Implemented | Adapter-based task execution now runs targeted Jest tests in child processes with timeouts, structured task results, and a runner endpoint for blueprint step execution. |
| 4 | Editor UI basics & anchor navigation | Implemented | The Electron renderer now loads blueprint metadata, renders a Monaco editor and file tree, opens real workspace files, and jumps to `TASK:` anchors for selected steps. |
| 5 | Learning Surface & Guidance Console | Implemented | Each unit now opens in a technical brief with quick checks, then transitions into a focused execution mode with a persistent guidance console, deterministic hints, and targeted task submission. |
| 6 | Task lifecycle & telemetry | Pending | Not started. |
| 7 | Edit tracking & anti-cheat | Pending | Not started. |
| 8 | Live Guide orchestration & LLM integration | Pending | Not started. |
| 9 | Architect static generator | Pending | Not started. |
| 10 | Rollback UX & snapshot management | Pending | Not started. |
| 11 | Multi-language adapters | Pending | Not started. |
| 12 | Dynamic plan mutation & persistence | Pending | Not started. |
| 13 | E2E validation | Pending | Not started. |

## Current Changeset Scope

- Rework the renderer to match the production workspace direction: narrow file explorer, centered top bar, Monaco as the primary canvas, and a true floating guidance card.
- Make the brief flow a full-screen overlay that covers the entire workspace, including the explorer and editor, before the user enters implementation mode.
- Add light and dark theme support to the renderer and Monaco integration.
- Keep the Phase 5 interaction model intact: quick checks, targeted task submission, guide prompts, and local hint levels.
- Keep app-side helper tests and the Phase 5 verification path green after the UI refactor.

## Verification

- Passed: static blueprint integrity check over [`/Users/abhinavmishra/solin/socrates/blueprints/workflow-runtime/project-blueprint.json`](/Users/abhinavmishra/solin/socrates/blueprints/workflow-runtime/project-blueprint.json) confirmed all 3 steps reference starter files with anchors and existing test files.
- Passed: `pnpm verify:phase1`.
- Passed: `pnpm verify:phase2`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/shared typecheck`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/runner typecheck`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/runner test`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/runner task:test`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/shared build`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/runner build`.
- Passed: `pnpm verify:phase3`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/app typecheck`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/app build`.
- Passed: `pnpm verify:phase4`.
- Passed: `pnpm --filter @construct/app test`.
- Passed: `pnpm verify:phase5`.
- Not run in this sandbox: a bind-based smoke test for the HTTP endpoint, because local listen attempts from the test process hit `EPERM`.
- Pending: `pnpm dev` smoke check for the Electron app and runner.

## Blockers

- None for Phase 5 implementation.

## Next Phase

Phase 6 starts with the real task lifecycle: pre-task snapshots, persisted task results, attempt tracking, and local telemetry storage.
